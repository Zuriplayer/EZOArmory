# Changelog

All notable changes to EZOArmory are documented here.

## 0.1.0

Initial scaffold.

- Addon skeleton for the EZO family: manifest, versioning tool, bilingual
  localization (EN/ES), optional LibDebugLogger diagnostics, SavedVariables and
  a LibAddonMenu settings panel with the shared EZO purple info headers.
- Trial and boss reference data for all 14 trials (`modules/zones_trials.lua`),
  keyed by zone id with ordered boss lists.
- EZOCore integration: addon registration, settings-panel registration with LAM
  fallback, language-preference consumer and debug controller. Works standalone
  when EZOCore is absent.
